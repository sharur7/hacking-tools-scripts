# MAC address changer
A media access control address (MAC address) is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for use as a network address in communications within a network segment. This use is common in most IEEE 802 networking technologies, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. The following cross platform script can change the MAC address of a device.

## Running script
  * Run `python mac-change.py <New MAC address>`
  * for e.g `python mac-change.py 2e:3e:3e:5f:5a:6f`

## Output

```txt
Old MAC address: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
New MAC address: 2e:3e:3e:5f:5a:6f
```

Old MAC address is printed in Yellow and new MAC address is printed in green.
